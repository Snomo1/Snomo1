    <div style="font-weight: bold;">Hello, I'm Swagatam Biswas</div>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      A diligent professional hailing from Kolkata, India. With a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), I've ventured into the realm of data analytics. My journey began with part-time roles at Meta Arcadia Private Limited, where I honed my skills in database management and data cleaning using tools like Microsoft Excel and SQL. Then transitioning to a full-time position as a Research Analyst at G.K. Academic Private Limited, I dedicated a full year in assisting MS and PhD students in their data-driven research. My responsibilities involved frequent communication with clients to gather feedback and identify accessible data sources essential for addressing the business challenges, via platforms such as Statista and other online resources. Subsequently, I processed and formatted the data using Google Big Query, MS Excel or MySQL. My current goal is to pursue a Master's degree in Data Science in Germany.
